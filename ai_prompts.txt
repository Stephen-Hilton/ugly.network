generate a docker compose file that will create a new container running Alpine linux, install postgreSQL 16.4, python 3.12.7, and then pip install the latest version of FastAPI.   Create an application database user for PostgreSQL called UglySQL that has full access to all operations on the database.   Create one API called ExecuteSQL, that on GET call,  executes the supplied  query on the PostgreSQL database and returns the result in JSON format.   Configure the API to run on the container's port 8459.
